### Python Project Portfolio
**[Case_Study_Classification_Model](https://avela0317.github.io/AV_JW_Unit8_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study, a classification model was used to predict a binary target variable of an anonymized dataset. The three methods used were eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest, & Support Vector Machine (SVM). The metrics used to score models was Accuracy and LogLoss.

**[Case_Study_Imputations_with_AutoML_Model](https://avela0317.github.io/AV_JW_Unit10_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study, different imputation methods were used to address missing values within the Sberbank Russian Housing Market dataset.  The Pycaret machine learning package was then used to quickly run a large number of different regression algorithms on the same dataset.
