## Welcome to my GitHub site!

Within this portfolio, I will be providing information for various projects that I have completed.  As you will notice, Python is my main Data Science tool, but I also have experience with Excel, Tableau,& SQL.

### Python Project Portfolio
**[Case_Study_Classification_Model](https://avela0317.github.io/Python/AV_JW_Unit8_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study, a classification model was used to predict a binary target variable of an anonymized dataset. The three methods used were eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest, & Support Vector Machine (SVM). The metrics used to score models was Accuracy and LogLoss.

**[Case_Study_Imputations_with_AutoML_Model](https://avela0317.github.io/Python/AV_JW_Unit10_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study, different imputation methods were used to address missing values within the Sberbank Russian Housing Market dataset.  The Pycaret machine learning package was then used to quickly run a large number of different regression algorithms on the same dataset.

**[Model3](https://avela0317.github.io/Python/AV_JW_Unit8_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study,

### SQL Skills Overview and Resource Portfolio
**[SQL Querying Notebook](https://avela0317.github.io/SQL/SQL_DS_Tutorial.html):** 
<br/>This notebook was used to keep track of relevant queries associated to each concept discussed within the tutorial.  Topics included are as follows:
- SQL Query Basics 
- Functions 
- Grouping Data & Computing Aggregates
- Subqueries 
- CASE Clause 
- Correlated Subqueries 
- Table Joins
- Window Functions

### Excel Skills Overview and Resource Portfolio

**[Forecast_Income_and_Dashboard_of_Online_Retail_Store](https://avela0317.github.io/Excel/Online_Retail_Dashboard.xlsx):** 
<br/>An online retail dataset was downloaded from the UCI ML dataset repository to forecast income and create a dashboard using only Excel.  Since this is an example exercise, randomized sales data was created for 2010.  Also, transactional information was limited only to customers outside the United Kingdom.  The final dataset consisted of 88,907 rows of data with 21 columns (8_Original + 13_UserCreated).  

Brief overview of skills used are as follows:
- Forecasting
- Dynamic Chart Building with Slicer Use
- Various Lookups (Vlookup, Index/Match, etc.)
- Pivot Tables
- IF, AND, & Concatenation Formulas
