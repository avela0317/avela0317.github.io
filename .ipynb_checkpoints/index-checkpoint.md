### Python Project Portfolio
*Note: the following links will take you to the specific html reports hosted within this github repository.*

**[Case_Study_Classification_Model](https://avela0317.github.io/Python/AV_JW_Unit8_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study, a classification model was used to predict a binary target variable of an anonymized dataset. The three methods used were eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest, & Support Vector Machine (SVM). The metrics used to score models was Accuracy and LogLoss.

**[Case_Study_Imputations_with_AutoML_Model](https://avela0317.github.io/Python/AV_JW_Unit10_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study, different imputation methods were used to address missing values within the Sberbank Russian Housing Market dataset.  The Pycaret machine learning package was then used to quickly run a large number of different regression algorithms on the same dataset.

**[Case_Study_WebScraping_RaceData](https://avela0317.github.io/Python/AV_JW_Unit4_CaseStudy.html):** 
<br/>Within this case study, race data was scraped using BeautifulSoup with the associated text cleaned and transformed prior to creating a presentable dataframe.  The data gathered and used was female ten-mile race data from the Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run website. Techniques utilized throughout this case study include web scraping, function creation, regex pattern utilization, variable type modifications, and dataframe creation. The final dataframe consisted of races ran from from 1999 through 2012.

### Tableau Project Portfolio
*Note: the following links will take you to my tableu public site where all of these data visualization workbooks are hosted.*

**[World_Demographics_Animation](https://public.tableau.com/profile/avela0317#!/vizhome/World_Demographics_Animation_16100566502730/WorldDemographics):** 
<br/>An animation dashboard displaying life expectancy and fertility rate by country.  Playing the animation will show the changes from 1960-2013.

**[Australia_Expansion_Analysis_Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/avela0317#!/vizhome/Australia_Expansion_Analysis/FinalPresentation):** 
<br/>A storyboard analyzing Australian Demographics and Retail Trade data.  The first slide starts off with simple Competitor Analysis until it progresses to a Sales Per Capita Forecast.

**[UK_Bank_Customers_Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/avela0317#!/vizhome/UK_Bank_Dashboard_16098613765890/UKCustomerSegmentations):** 
<br/>A dashboard detailing UK Bank Customers.  All filters/options were connected to have a dynamic dashboard experience.

*Note: the following link will take you to the specific html reports hosted within this github repository.*

**[SQL Querying Notebook](https://avela0317.github.io/SQL/SQL_DS_Tutorial.html):** 
<br/>This notebook was used to keep track of relevant queries associated to each concept discussed within the tutorial.  Topics included are as follows:
- SQL Query Basics 
- Functions 
- Grouping Data & Computing Aggregates
- Subqueries 
- CASE Clause 
- Correlated Subqueries

### Excel Skills Overview and Resource Portfolio
*Note: the following link will allow you to download the excel file hosted within this github repository.*

**[Forecast_Income_and_Dashboard_of_Online_Retail_Store](https://avela0317.github.io/Excel/Online_Retail_Dashboard.xlsx):** 
<br/>An online retail dataset was downloaded from the UCI ML dataset repository to forecast income and create a dashboard using only Excel.  Since this is an example exercise, randomized sales data was created for 2010.  Also, transactional information was limited only to customers outside the United Kingdom.  The final dataset consisted of 88,907 rows of data with 21 columns (8_Original + 13_UserCreated).  

Brief overview of skills used are as follows:
- Forecasting
- Dynamic Chart Building with Slicer Use
- Various Lookups (Vlookup, Index/Match, etc.)
- Pivot Tables
- IF, AND, & Concatenation Formulas
